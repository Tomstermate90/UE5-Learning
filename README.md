# UE5 Military Simulator Learning Project

**Developer**: [Tomer Levi]
**Timeline**: 8-week intensive learning program
**Target**: Application to Stride Interactive military simulation project
**Technology Stack**: Unreal Engine 5.3, C++, Blueprint Visual Scripting

## Project Overview

This repository documents my journey learning Unreal Engine 5 specifically for military training simulation development. The goal is to build a multiplayer combat training scenario that demonstrates core game development skills required for professional military simulation projects.

## Learning Objectives

- Master UE5 C++ programming and Blueprint integration
- Implement networked multiplayer gameplay systems
- Create realistic weapon and combat mechanics
- Develop AI systems for training scenarios
- Build professional-quality code and documentation

## Repository Structure

- **Projects/**: Unreal Engine project files and source code
- **Documentation/**: Learning notes, progress reports, technical docs
- **Resources/**: Assets, references, research materials
- **Scripts/**: Utility scripts and build tools
- **Builds/**: Compiled game builds for testing
